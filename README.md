Overview
The Image Processing Filters project involves creating a program that allows users to apply various filters to images. This can include effects like grayscale, sepia, blur, sharpen, and edge detection. The project focuses on understanding image manipulation techniques and provides a hands-on approach to learning about pixels and color spaces.

Objectives
Learn fundamental concepts of image processing.
Implement different filters using algorithms.
Create a user-friendly interface for uploading and displaying images.
Understand how to manipulate pixel data directly.
